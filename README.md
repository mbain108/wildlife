# Project Overview
# Project Setup
WILDLIFE INTAKE APPLICATION, is an online application created specifically to assist wildlife care facilities in the collection and use of patient-related data. 

### My vision
This application will include an admission form which uses standardized terminology, most of which will be provided in convenient and efficient drop-down lists, for ease of use and consistency in reporting. The application will be designed to assist users in collecting critical information about their patients, compiling and using that information in a variety of ways. One of the most basic, yet attractive features of the system will be the ability to automatically generate information for annual reports for state and federal permitting agencies.
 
Wildlife care facilities will be able to compile, sort, and search the information contained in patient records, based on many fields, or combination of fields, within the records, including species, date, rescue/release locations, types of injuries, ages of the patients, etc. The use of a standard intake template, and a single set of terms and definitions, also means that data on patients in multiple care facilities can be combined, analyzed and studied. I am hoping to develop a comprehensive understanding of what species are being presented for care, where and when they are being found, and what factors are leading to their injuries, illnesses, or other problems.
